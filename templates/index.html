		<p>The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a color point coat and blue eyes. Its form is large and muscular and its coat is silky soft and semi-longhair. Ragdolls were developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s. They are best known for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name 'Ragdoll' is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.<p>

		<p>Particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, Ragdolls are often known as 'dog-like cats' or 'puppy-like cats'. This moniker is due to their tendency to follow people around, comfort when physically handled, and relative lack of aggression toward other pets.</p>

		<p>Ragdolls are powerful, large, and heavy cats that are distinguishable by their V-shape markings on their forehead, large round blue eyes, soft thick coat, thick limbs, long tail, and soft bodies. Their color rings are commonly tri-colour or bi-color.</p>

		<p>The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, dense coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, orange eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.<p>

		<p>It is one of the most ancient cat breeds known. In modern times, it remains the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). A quarter of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK.</p>

		<p>The breed's good-natured appearance and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. The Cat Fanciers' Association profile reads: "When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'."</p>
